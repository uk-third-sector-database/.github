Welcome to the home of the UK Third Sector Database! We are an [ESRC funded group of collaborators](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FX000524%2F1) seeking to improve data infrastructure surrounding the UK’s third sector and civil society more generally. The grant is entitled “Improving Access to and Use of Organisation-Level Data on the Third Sector and Civil Society” (Project Reference: ES/X000524/1). In this repository you can find all of the code that powers our data, dashboards, public APIs and tutorials. We also have a [website](https://uk-third-sector-database.github.io/).
